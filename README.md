# Sparta Remix Studio (2022)

Sparta Remix Studio (SRS) is an audio and video editing software, aimed at the creation of a specific type of music and asociated videos, the YTPMV and more specifically, the Sparta Remix.
The difference between SRS and most other video editing software is that SRS is well aware of the idea of reusing video frames. In Sparta Remixes, it is common that the same video clip is played hundreds of times. Instead of reading the same video file over and over, the needed frames are stored in memory making SRS less laggy than most alternatives, thus making it a less general-purpose video editor and more specific-purpose video editor.

## Project status
The SRS project of 2022 is still in developement.

Unlike the project of 2019, this project is extendible through Managed Extensibility Framework and so others will be able to indirectly contribute functionality to SRS.
